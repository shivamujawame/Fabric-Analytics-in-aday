# Introduction 
In our scenario, Sales Data comes from the ERP system and is stored in an ADLS Gen2. It gets updated at noon / 12 PM every day. We need to transform and ingest this data into Lakehouse and use it in our model.

There are multiple ways to ingest this data. 

- **Shortcuts:** This creates a link to the data, and we can use Visual query views to transform it. We are going to use Shortcuts in this lab.
- **Notebooks:** This requires us to write code. It is a developer friendly approach.
- **Dataflow Gen2:** You are probably familiar with Power Query or Dataflow Gen1. Dataflow Gen2, as the name indicates, is the newer version of Dataflow. It provides all the capabilities of Power Query / Dataflow Gen1 with the added ability to transform and ingest data into multiple data sources. We are going to introduce this in the next couple of labs.
- **Data Pipeline:** This is an orchestration tool. Activities can be orchestrated to extract, transform, and ingest data. We will be using Data Pipeline to execute Dataflow Gen2 activity which in turn will perform extraction, transformation, and ingestion. 

We will start by creating a Shortcut to ingest data into a Lakehouse from ADLS Gen2 data source. Once ingested, we are going to use Visual query views to transform it.

By the end of this lab, you will have learned: 
- How to create Shortcut to Lakehouse
- How to transform data using Visual query

# Shortcut to ADLS Gen2

## Task 1: Create Shortcut
Shortcuts are used to create a link to the target location. Shortcuts provide access to the data without needing to physically move the data into the lakehouse. This is like creating shortcuts in Windows desktop.

1. Let’s navigate back to the **Fabric workspace (1)** you created in the Lab 2, Task8.
2. If you have not navigated away after the previous lab, you will be in the Lakehouse screen. If you have navigated away that is fine. Select **lh_FAIAD (2)** to navigate to the Lakehouse. 
3. In the Explorer panel, select the **ellipsis (3)** next to **Tables**.
4. Select **New Shortcut (4)**.

    ![](../media/lab-03/2712025(15).png)

5. **New Shortcut** dialog opens. Under **External sources**, select **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image008.jpg)
 
6. Select **Create new connection (1)**.
7. Enter the following link for the **URL** property: `https://stvnextblobstorage.dfs.core.windows.net/fabrikam-sales` **(2)**
8. Select **Shared Access Signature (SAS) (3)** from the Authentication kind dropdown.

9. Copy the **SAS token** and paste it into the **SAS token (4)** field.  

   - **SAS token:** <inject key="Sas token"></inject>

10. Select **Next (5)** on the bottom right of the screen.

    ![](../media/lab-03/fa15.png)

11. You will be connected to ADLS Gen2 with the directory structure displayed in the left panel. Expand **Delta-Parquet-Format-FY25 (1)**.

12. **Select** the following directories **(2)** and then click on **Next (3)**.

    a. Application.Cities

    b. Application.Countries

    c. Application.StateProvinces

    d. DateDim

    e. Sales.BuyingGroups

    f. Sales.Customers

    g. Sales.InvoiceLines

    h. Sales.Invoices

    i. Warehouse.StockGroups

    j. Warehouse.StockItemStockGroups

    k. Warehouse.StockItems

    **Note:** Sales.Invoices_May is the only directory that is **not** selected.

    ![](../media/lab-03/fa16.png)

13. You will be navigated to the next dialog where we can edit the names. Select the **Edit icon (1)** under Actions for Application.Cities.

14. Rename Application.Cities to **Cities (2)**.

15. Select the check mark next to the name to save the change **(3)**.

    ![](../media/lab-03/fa17.png)
 
16. Similarly, rename the Shortcut Names as below:

    a. Application.Countries to **Countries**

    b. Application.StateProvinces to **States**

    c. DateDim to **Date**

    d. Sales.BuyingGroups to **BuyingGroups**

    e. Sales.Customers to **Customers**

    f. Sales.InvoiceLines to **InvoiceLineItems**

    g. Sales.Invoices to **Invoices**

    h. Warehouse.StockGroups to **ProductGroups**

    i. Warehouse.StockItemStockGroups to **ProductItemGroup**

    j. Warehouse.StockItems to **ProductItem**

    **Note:** Double-check the names. A typo may cause errors during the lab.

17. Select **Create** to create the Shortcut.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image017.jpg)

18. Notice all the Shortcuts are created as Tables. Select **BuyingGroups** table and notice we can see a preview of the data in the data panel.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image020.png)
 
The next step is to transform the data, so we can create a semantic model. We are going to create views to transform the data.

# Transform data using Visual Query

## Task 2: Create Geo view using Visual Query
1. We can access the lakehouse using a SQL endpoint. This provides the ability to query the data and create views. On the **top right** of the screen, select **Lakehouse (1) -> SQL analytics endpoint (2)**.

    ![](../media/lab-03/2712025(21).png)
 
   You will be navigated to SQL analytics endpoint. Notice the Explorer panel has changed. You now can create views, stored procedures, queries and more. We are going to create a visual query as it provides a Power Query like interface and save this as a view.

   We will start by creating a Geo view. We need to merge data from Cities, States and Countriesquery to create the Geo view.

2. From the top menu, click the drop-down next to **New SQL query (1)** and then select **New visual query (2)**.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image026.jpg)

1. To build a query, we need to add tables to the Visual Query panel. Click on the ellipsis next to the **Cities (1)** table and select **Insert into canvas (2)**.

    ![](../media/lab-03/2712025(17).png)

1. Repeat the same steps for the **States** and **Countries** tables.
 
   We need to merge these queries. And visual query comes with the option to use Power Query editor. Let’s use this, since we are familiar with this.

4. From the menu in Visual query editor, select the **Open in popup** icon (towards the right). You will be navigated to Power Query editor.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image031.png)
 
5. With Cities query selected, from the Power Query editor ribbon, select **Home - > Merge queries -> Merge queries as new**. Merge queries dialog opens.

   >**Note:** If you do not see Merge Queries in the Home Ribbon, then click the drop-down for **Combine** and **Merge queries as new**.

   ![](../media/lab-03/image033.jpg) 
 
6. In the **left table for merge**, select **Cities**.
7. In the **right table for merge**, select **States**.
8. Select **StateProvinceID** columns from both the tables. We are going to join using this column.
9. Select **Inner** as the **Join kind**.
10. Select **OK**.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image036.jpg)
 
    Notice a new query called Merge has been created. We need a few columns from States.

11. In the **Data view** (bottom panel), click on the **double arrow** next to the **States** column (last column to the right).

12. A panel opens. **Select** following columns:

    a. StateProvinceCode

    b. StateProvinceName

    c. CountryID

    d. SalesTerritory

13. Select **OK**.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image039.jpg)
 
    We need to merge Countries query now. 

14. With Merge query selected, select **Home -> Merge queries -> Merge queries** from the ribbon.

    **Note:** If you do not see Merge Queries in the Home Ribbon, then click the drop-down for **Combine** and select **Merge queries**.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image041.jpg)
 
15. Merge query dialog opens. In the **Right table for merge**, select **Countries**.
16. Select **CountryID** columns from both the tables. We are going to join using this column.
17. Select **Inner** as the **Join kind**.
18. Select **OK**.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image044.jpg)
 
    We need a few columns from Countries.

19. In the **Data view** (bottom panel), click on the **double arrow** next to the **Countries** column.
20. A panel opens. **Select** following columns:

    a. CountryName

    b. FormalName

    c. IsoAlpha3Code

    d. IsoNumericCode

    e. CountryType

    f. Continent

    g. Region

    h. Subregion

21. Select **OK**.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image047.jpg)
 
    We do not need all the columns. Let’s select only those we need.

22. With Merge query selected, from the ribbon select **Home -> Choose columns -> Choose columns**.

    **Note:** If the Choose columns option is not visible, you can find it under Manage columns.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image050.jpg)

23. Choose columns dialog opens. **Uncheck** the following columns.

    a. StateProvinceID

    b. Location

    c. LastEditedBy

    d. ValidFrom

    e. ValidTo

    f. CountryID

24. Select **OK**.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image053.png)
 
    Notice the process is like Power Query, we have all the steps recorded both in the Applied Steps panel on the right and the visual view. Let’s rename Merge query and Enable load, so that the data is loaded from this query.

25. **Right-click on Merge** query in the Queries (left) panel. Select **Rename** and rename the query to **Geo**.
26. **Right-click on Geo** query in the Queries (left) panel. Select **Enable Load** to enable this query.
27. Make sure that Cities, States and Countries queries are **disabled**.
28. Select **Save**, found in the bottom right of the power query editor.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image056.jpg)

    We will be navigated to Visual query editor. Let’s now save this query as a view.

    **Note:** All the steps we performed using Power Query editor can be performed using Visual query editor as well.

29. From the Visual query editor menu select **Save as view**.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image059.jpg)
 
    Save as view dialog opens. Notice the SQL query is available. You can review it, if you choose it.

30. Enter **Geo** as **View name**.
31. Select **OK** to save the view. 

    ![](../media/lab-03/2712025(19).png)
 
    You will get an alert once the view is saved.

32. In the Explorer (left) panel, expand **Views**. We have the newly created Geo view.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image065.png)
 
## Task 3: Create Reseller view using Visual Query
Let’s create Reseller view which is created by merging Customers table with BuyingGroups table. This time around we will create the view using Visual query.
1. From the top menu, click the drop-down next to **New SQL query (1)** and then select **New visual query (2)**.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image067.jpg)

24. Highlight the last two lines of code ( in Source) and **delete** it.
25. Select **OK** to save the changes.

    ![](../media/lab-03/image124.jpg)
 
    If it is easier, delete all the code in the Advanced Editor and paste the below code into Advanced Editor.

    ```
    let
      Source = Table.NestedJoin(InvoiceLineItems, {"InvoiceID"}, Invoices, {"InvoiceID"}, "Invoices", JoinKind.Inner),
        #"Expanded Invoice" = Table.ExpandTableColumn(Source, "Invoices", {"CustomerID", "BillToCustomerID", "SalespersonPersonID", "InvoiceDate"}, {"CustomerID", "BillToCustomerID", "SalespersonPersonID", "InvoiceDate"}),
        #"Removed Other Columns" = Table.SelectColumns(#"Expanded Invoice",{"InvoiceLineID", "InvoiceID", "StockItemID", "Quantity", "UnitPrice", "TaxRate", "TaxAmount", "LineProfit", "ExtendedPrice", "CustomerID", "SalespersonPersonID", "InvoiceDate"}),
        #"Renamed Columns" = Table.RenameColumns(#"Removed Other Columns",{{"CustomerID", "ResellerID"}}),
        #"Merged Queries" = Table.NestedJoin(#"Renamed Columns", {"ResellerID"}, Reseller, {"ResellerID"}, "Customer", JoinKind.Inner),
        #"Added Custom" = Table.AddColumn(#"Merged Queries", "Sales Amount", each [ExtendedPrice] - [TaxAmount]),
        #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Added Custom",{{"Sales Amount", type number}}),
        #"Removed Columns" = Table.RemoveColumns(#"Changed Type",{"Customer"})
    in
        #"Removed Columns"
    ```
